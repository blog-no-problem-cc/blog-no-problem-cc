There is a tendency to project everything: from a minor life phase to conquering galaxies. I’m not going to dig into details of misusing the term ‘project’ and ‘project management’ activities associated with it. I would rather stick to the classical project definition and make an attempt to find a way of comparing projects belonging to diverse application areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skyrocketing development of technologies boosts new business segments and secures the importance of project management for a dozen years ahead. A project is a temporary entity aimed to deliver a product, a service, or a result according to a specific business case. It is not an operational activity and has inherent characteristics, which distinguish it from day-to-day business. Each project is unique, lies at the intersection of the three interdependent targets: time, budget, and result(s), and always possesses a risk of not achieving some or all of these targets. It requires a special team or even a project organization to ensure proper management and the desired outcome. And last, but not least: a project has complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-actually-project-complexity&quot;&gt;What is actually project complexity?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different dimensions affecting the complexity of a project. For example, budget, duration, the intricacy of applied technologies, controllability of key stakeholders, difficulty in handling involved groups with specific clout (contractors, authorities, etc.), the existence of high political risks, and many others, which can be derived from the PESTLE or other comparable analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no unambiguous dimensions for complexity, which are valid for all projects. In practice, each company selects appropriate dimensions and sets its own parameters to complexity to differentiate its projects. Project budget is the most commonly used characteristic of project complexity. For a homogeneous project portfolio, this one-dimension differentiator totally makes sense and works perfectly. However, for a portfolio, which embraces diverse projects from a variety of industries, adhesion to one dimension of complexity will likely lead to a comparison of apples and oranges. It is not an easy task to define complexity by setting practical parameters of comparison for a diversified group of projects. Obviously, several dimensions should be used to emphasize core differences, risks, or critical factors for these projects. Depending on a company’s internal standards a presentation of complexity for heterogeneous projects can be visualized by charts and diagrams, categorized by weighted characteristics, or other approaches might be used to support an illustration of the selected data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparison-of-diverse-projects&quot;&gt;Comparison of diverse projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of any project is its uniqueness. For R&amp;amp;D projects this statement has apparent validity, in other fields project originality assumes a unique combination of phases and features suitable for the specific case. To provide one of the possible ways of comparing totally different projects, I’d like to demonstrate some real-world projects as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small company with top technical expertise in some niche areas, that designs its own high-tech products and develops exclusive solutions for customers’ projects, has taken a development project for a very specific business case. The project is to be based on one of the emerging technologies. There is no evidence or reference suggesting that the selected technology has ever been applied to similar tasks. However, some key stakeholders on the customer side are excited about this project because its successful results integrated into their own products might give their company a drastic competitive advantage. The estimated project duration is 12-18 months, the planned budget is 0,5 million Euro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge international company with branches in more than 20 countries decides to implement a modern cloud-based recruiting system. This new corporate solution has to replace all local recruiting systems, must be integrated with other HR tools, and is to fully comply with corporate IT policies. Its implementation most probably entails significant changes in corporate and local HR processes. At the same time, a unified solution is to yield a significant cost-saving effect in the future. The project has received support from the company’s top management. The planned project duration is about one year, the estimated budget is around one million Euro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A medium-sized company, that actively cooperates with a lot of contractors good at specific parts of construction work, manages a project to build a small tunnel in a mountain. The tunnel will help to reduce transit traffic intensity in the nearest city. At the same time, this mountain area is inhabited by species whose wellbeing during the construction phase might raise concerns among local environmentalists. The estimated project budget is more than ten million Euro, the estimated duration is 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To visualize a possible comparison of the above-mentioned projects I decided to use a well-known bubble chart, which is a common illustrative tool for a data set with two to four dimensions. The first two dimensions are presented as coordinates, the third as bubble-size, and the fourth as color. The beauty of this chart is that depending on your need and available data it is possible to use a two-dimensional picture or extends it to a three- or even four-dimensional presentation of data without sacrificing readability.
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2022/2022-04-04-bubble-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve selected the following dimensions: budget, technology, and stakeholder. From my point of view, these parameters have eye-catching differences for these projects and can be placed as coordinates and bubble-size to visualize the distinctions. Owing to the availability of quantitative data about the budgets, it is possible to use a discrete numerical scale for this dimension, while some ordinal scales should be applied to the rest. For the fourth dimension I’ve used an estimated probability of the risk, that the project outcome won’t reach one or more targets (results, budget, time), and the simple ordinal scale (low-medium-high) for color-coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These differentiators were chosen based on available project pitches and for illustrative purposes only. The more project details are available, the richer the field of possible dimensions, parameters, scales, and comparison methods becomes. However, before starting a selection of suitable characteristics you should have a clear vision of what you would like to get as a result keeping the intended application in mind. It will help a lot to reduce overdoing and waste of effort during this exciting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dealing with diverse projects the reasonable usage of multi-dimensional criteria to highlight project complexity serves as a helpful instrument to get a targeted snapshot of projects’ overview, to monitor and keep a project portfolio balance, and can support in ‘go/ no go’ decision making about new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No matter what you stand for, no matter what your ultimate purpose may be, you must take into account the effects of your actions on others, as well as their potential effects on you.”&lt;/em&gt;  R. Edward Freeman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have received a new challenging task — to lead one of the HR projects. It’s awesome! Congratulations! As the first excitement wears off, you are to decide: &lt;em&gt;Where and how to start? What factors, aspects, and specifics should be considered?&lt;/em&gt; — and dozens of other questions and points to fulfill the requirements of your project. I’m not going to compete with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pmi.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PMI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axelos.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Axelos&lt;/a&gt; in providing a comprehensive methodology in project management, rather give some practitioner tips on what matters to HR project success and list some valuable sources where to glean further hints and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, an &lt;a href=&quot;/si/en/PM-HR_strangers-or-buddies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HR project&lt;/a&gt; is initiated as a response to changes in business strategy, a value-added HR initiative, digitalization of processes, or any combination of these. HR projects are diverse by purpose, nature, duration, available resources, and budget. However, some common critical issues and roadblocks can be present in any HR project (Figure 1). 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2022/2022-02-04-Figure1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
An encounter with some of them might require significant efforts and additional resources to get a project back on track while facing the full set will most probably prove fatal for project success. On the other hand, proper conscious preventive activities and skillful management empower one to turn these hindrances into powerful project drivers and success factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such factor is stakeholders, i.e. groups, persons, authorities, or parties that might have a vested interest in any phase of a project, program, or initiative. Careless or slipshod stakeholder management can bury any project or significantly multiply its complexity. HR projects are not an exception to this general rule. It is well known that even minor changes related to humans might have huge and unforeseen effects. HR projects are dedicated to and dealing with people. Sometimes it is not easy to predict the entire range of potential reactions of the affected groups and individuals and build up a complete overview of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholder-identification&quot;&gt;Stakeholder identification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first core step to success in any project is the proper identification of stakeholders. There is a wider range of stakeholders which may affect, or be affected by, an HR project. These stakeholders may be internal or external to a company and may become supporters or blockers of the project and its progress. For most HR projects, there is a need for involvement of other departments, such as IT, finance, communication, etc., that favor classification of stakeholders into the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upward&lt;/strong&gt; (sponsor, steering committee),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;downward&lt;/strong&gt; (project team and contributing experts),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;outward&lt;/strong&gt; (providers, employees, regulators) and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sideward&lt;/strong&gt; (peers who collaborate in sharing resources and/or information).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a secret that some HR projects in big corporations have a complex network of relationships and hidden political games in their project scopes. For these projects, it makes sense to use more complex instruments to ensure comprehensive identification and further intentional engagement of stakeholders. One of these instruments is the salience model (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2022/2022-02-04-Figure2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suggests that &lt;em&gt;“the question of stakeholder salience — the degree to which managers give priority to competing stakeholder claims — goes beyond the question of stakeholder identification, because the dynamics inherent in each relationship involve complex considerations”&lt;/em&gt; (Mitchell, R.; Agle B.; Wood, D. 1997). According to this model, stakeholders are classified based on the relative absence or presence of all or some of the three attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;power&lt;/strong&gt; (level of authority or the ability to bring about the outcomes they desire),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;legitimacy&lt;/strong&gt; (ones who “really count”),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urgency&lt;/strong&gt; (need for immediate attention).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders disposed of only one attribute are belonging to the group of latent stakeholders (dormant, discretionary, demanding). This group is worth identifying. However, any special attention and engagement actions to these stakeholders are not likely to be given. The group of expectant stakeholders (dominant, dangerous, dependent) comprises those with two attributes which in most cases lead to an active stance of stakeholders and requires thoughtful analysis and actions from a project team. By acquiring the missing third attribute, any expectant stakeholder can become a definitive stakeholder. This should be carefully tracked, monitored, and reflected in communication and engagement activities by a project team. Thus, the level of engagement between an HR project manager and expectant stakeholders is to be higher compared to latent ones or the same as required for the group of definitive stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholder identification is a dynamic process due to classification attributes being a variable that can change for any particular entity and over time, presenting a constructed reality, and a matter of multiple perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholder-analysis&quot;&gt;Stakeholder analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholder analysis is a pillar of stakeholder management and serves as a bridge between stakeholder identification and stakeholder engagement. Often, stakeholders have primary drivers in political, economical, social, technical, and legal fields, which determine their levels of interest in a project. Another important characteristic is the impact or the degree of a stakeholder’s influence on project phases and the final result. These two dimensions provide the basis for the stakeholder analysis and help to rank stakeholders and map them to different groups, for example, actively manage, manage, actively inform and inform. At the next stage, appropriate engagement and communication measures should be elaborated and implemented for each group of stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some projects with matted relationships between stakeholders, there is a need for an additional dimension, for example, level of authority, and/or weighting of applied characteristics to improve the depiction of a stakeholder community. The result of analysis for most HR projects can be presented in a form of a two-dimensional matrix or a three-dimensional cube, aimed at focusing productive efforts of a project team on critical sub-sets of stakeholders. It is worth noting that the characteristics of a stakeholder are not once and constantly fixed values. They do not have a steady state and are often changing over project phases. These changes find a reflection in altering engagement levels of different stakeholders, which can be traced by a so-called stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. The matrix provides a comparison between the current and the desired support levels of a project by stakeholders. Depending on the project’s specifics, any appropriate nominal or ordinal scale might be used to categorize the support levels. The assessment results indicate outliers within the previously identified groups of stakeholders to finetune engagement and communication activities for groups and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes of a stakeholder’s attitude changes can be found in a psychological domain scrutinized by various scientists and practitioners over the last century. The landscape of psychological theories is multifarious and provides a fruitful basis for further development of new models and frameworks and a broad room for its application (Figure 3). 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2022/2022-02-04-Figure3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
For example, the iceberg model can help to rationalize some unexpected changes in a stakeholder’s behavior. According to this model, the invisible part of human internal drivers is significantly deeper than the visible one. It comprises multiple layers, which in most cases are not purposively demonstrated, but can be triggered at any moment. This is one reason why, a stakeholder might spring up during the project implementation, which can negatively impact the timing, scope, or resources of the project. Another plausible reason is that this stakeholder most probably had that opinion before, but you just did not know it or did not pay enough attention to sustain and develop his commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholder-engagement&quot;&gt;Stakeholder engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stakeholder engagement is another important component of stakeholder management that ensures the productive involvement of stakeholders in decision making and project execution, according to their needs, interests, and impact. The ultimate engagement goal is to build and maintain the continued commitment of stakeholders during all project phases by instrumentally managing expectations, addressing risks and concerns, clarifying and resolving issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commitment is the clue that tacks people and the project results. It is an intangible, but noticeable and altering substance, which might be difficult to obtain and easy to lose. The development of stakeholder commitment usually follows the sequential stages of the commitment curve and passes through the main phases: preparation, acceptance, commitment (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2022/2022-02-04-Figure4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model depicts the critical stages where a stakeholder perception might change from the supportive mode to a blocking one or return to earlier stages, as stakeholders learn more about the project and what it will require from them or give them. Obviously, each stakeholder has an individual commitment curve, which might have a minor or significant deviation from the average pace of the assigned stakeholder group. It explains the appearance of outliers within the classified stakeholder groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altering commitment can be another reason for a stakeholder’s attitude changes and the further necessity to allocate stakeholders to different groups during the project. It also proves the necessity to intentionally monitor and analyze revealed changes, and adapt planned stakeholder engagement and communication activities respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholder-communication&quot;&gt;Stakeholder communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication is tightly embedded in the stakeholder engagement process and serves as its engine. It is vitally important for an HR project success to select appropriate methods for delivering the first contact messages to stakeholders, as this is a prerequisite to creating an awareness of the project. There is a wide range of options including a company’s internal media, memos, staff meetings, personal contact, and other mechanisms to launch a forward movement through the stakeholder commitment curve. However, communication efforts do not always produce progress toward the next stages in the way of stakeholder commitment. It is so frustrating when, after many meetings and memos about an initiative, some stakeholders either are not prepared for it or react with total surprise when it affects them. In order to diminish a misunderstanding and possible resistance, proper communication to different stakeholders through relevant channels should be started as early as possible, be transparent, adaptive, clear, and precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ginger up the efficiency of internal and external communications, it is worth thinking over a stakeholder communication plan. Depending on the project complexity and a variety of the identified stakeholder groups, it can be highly detailed or broadly framed. An effective communication plan contains details of what information the project management team will send to, and receive from different stakeholder groups, through what channels information is to be distributed, and how often each stakeholder group is to be approached. As a general rule for HR projects, flexibility and incorporating stakeholder feedback into communications are to prevail over a formal following of the activities that were initially fixed in the communication plan. The stakeholder communication plan is dynamic and a subject of constant changes to address new challenges and issues popping up during a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High stakeholders’ commitment and involvement can propel any HR project to the sky, while lack of stakeholder support will tank even a brilliant HR initiative. Stakeholder management is exciting, but a tricky process, which requires continuous attention through all project phases. It is likely to be the first project management area to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, it requires continuous learning and upskilling. If a decade ago an employee with a learning aptitude could fully rely on an employee development strategy of his/her company to keep an appropriate level of competencies and to be fit for a job, in a modern world this strategy is outdated and no longer yields outstanding results. It is time to take a leading role for personal development into your own hands. Sounds great and promising, but the necessity of making choices in a vast variety of learning and development options might hack to death this idea even for a highly motivated person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being for a long time responsible for learning and talent development within a company and working on a side of learning providers, I would like to share some tips on how to choose appropriate activities in line with your development strategy. As an illustrative sample, I have selected a project management functional area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-define-your-learning-need&quot;&gt;Step 1. Define your learning need&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most essential steps that is tightly linked to your learning motivation and internal goals. I see the following major categories of needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;certification: formal recognition;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;knowledge: learning something new, closure of knowledge gaps, skills’ practice;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;networking: informal recognition and fun;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any combination of the above mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fulfil this step, you have to answer two questions:
&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; do I want/need to get as a result?
&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; do I want/ need it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: 
“I need to get a PRINCE2 certification because this is a requirement to lead strategic projects in my company.” “I want to get a PMI certification because I want to structure my knowledge and experience according to this methodology and to boost my PM-career.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need to learn the basics of project management to fulfil my current working task more effectively.” “I want to refresh my knowledge, learn something new to be prepared for bigger tasks/projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to extend my professional network, meet competent people and receive feedback, that might help to highlight gaps in my knowledge and skills.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-consider-learning-alternatives&quot;&gt;Step 2. Consider learning alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the learning purpose is defined, it is time to consider different alternatives, their pros and cons, and to decide on preferable ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your target is a specific certification, the first step is to check pre-requisites and mandatory requirements to be eligible for an application for certification. Usually, this information is available on the website of the certification organization. Some certification bodies allow an application for certification through their authorized training providers only and after a mandatory completion of one of their certification trainings. Here, you have fewer learning options to choose from, and the principal focus is to be shifted on a selection of a training provider. Other certification organizations do not have these strict requirements. In this case, you can directly apply for certification and, on the one hand, have more flexibility in making learning choices, on the other hand, you have to take full responsibility for a preparation process and a selection of learning methods, sources, and providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-07-08_certification.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
There are two main categories of preparation methods: self-study and guided learning. Self-study embraces activities like reading an official methodology manual, supporting narratives, and plenty of exam preparation guides; practicing on a variety of free tests; reading and watching tips on how to pass exams, etc. Self-study is a valuable supplement for any learning activity and for some people it might be the preferable and most effective way of learning. However, for many people, it is difficult to stay focused on a narrowed area of a certification preparation, to avoid puzzling by a methodology guide, to separate the wheat from the chaff in picking out the right content, and not to drown in the information ocean. In this case, guided learning offered by different training providers might be a durable option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the learning market, there are two categories of providers offered learnings as a certification preparation: training providers authorized by a certification organization and the rest. Authorization means that content and a methodology of an offered learning are met minimum quality requirements set by an organization (i.e. PMI, IPMA, Axelos, etc.) for its certification’s training, and knowledge after this learning is to be enough to pass a certification exam. In other words, authorization partially transfers the risk of poor quality of a training product to a certification organization, and you might notice it in a training price. Often differences in learning approaches, delivery methods, a focused content selection, and provided exam-tips between an authorized and a skilled non-authorized provider are not remarkably diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of any certification training is preparation for passing a certification exam. Attending it, you should expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;basic explanations of the selected methodology of project management and rational guidance through the methodology manual and standards;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;highlighting of critical areas and additional specific topics beyond the methodology guides to be familiar with;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an explanation of logic, criteria, a structure, and an organization of a certification process;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hints and tips on how to fill in an application form, to deal with tricky questions, and to wisely distribute time during your exam;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recommendations on frameworks/ processes/ structures/ formulas/ schemas, that must be memorized;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a solid practice in answering demo exam-questions, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your development focus lays more likely in knowledge and practice areas than obtaining one of the recognized certifications in project management, the variety of possible learning alternatives and training offers goes far beyond certification trainings. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-07-08_learnings.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to self-study options, there are plenty of MOOCs and learning courses offered by universities, individual and group offers of project management coaching, on-demand learnings, masterclasses and development offers in professional worldwide communities like PMI-community, OpenSAP, and many other small communities established and moderated by PM-training providers. Different combinations of these alternatives are powerful elements of the professional development of a project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth highlighting guided learning activities as essential elements of a personal development portfolio that create a learning experience to accelerate the acquisition of desired knowledge and skills. Training providers offer diverse learning products in different formats: from self-paced online learning to classroom trainings with a lot of intermediate combinations like online &amp;amp; classroom module programs, online self-paced &amp;amp; interactive sessions, webinars, and many others. Applying a proper instructional design a skilled training provider delivers high-quality results for any learning format. Therefore, for a training participant, a learning format is rather a subject of personal preferences than a differentiator of training’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, the core difference between available on the market trainings lays in a proportion of theoretical knowledge and skills’ practicing embedded into a training’s concept. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-07-08_continuum.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a certification training inclines to the theoretical extreme, while most trainings tend to be in the middle on this continuum combining theoretical parts and supporting practical exercises. A limited number of premium programs designed around a complicated practical case as a load-bearing element is shifted to the practice extreme. These programs aim at advanced skills training. They incorporate only the ultimate necessary and very condensed theoretical aspects of project management and mainly focus on learning by doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strengthen a long-lasting effect of guided learnings, a lot of training providers offer to join their private or public communities and alumni groups. Usually, professional networking is a great training follow-up as well as an intrinsically valuable development activity. There are a lot of possibilities for professional networking from the local to global levels by attending and contributing to a variety of professional communities, dozens of Meetup groups, social projects and initiatives, conferences, forums, and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-set-selection-criteria&quot;&gt;Step 3. Set selection criteria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to choose appropriate development activities, the selection criteria should be set. Besides personal preferences to one or another learning alternatives it is worth to decide on investments and answer on the three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much money&lt;/strong&gt; do you ready to invest into your professional development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time&lt;/strong&gt; do you ready to invest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much effort&lt;/strong&gt; do you ready to invest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interdependencies among these three parameters can be illustrated by the ‘golden triangle’ technique. There is the optimal combination of time, budget, and effort to achieve the set development target. Varying the parameters, you can influence a triangle’s shape, but not its area. In other words, if you decrease one parameter, this change is compensated by a significant increase of one of the rest two parameters or moderate increases of both. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-07-08_triangle.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
For example, if you need to reduce time in acquiring new knowledge and skills, this reduction can be done by increasing a development budget, i.e. to attend a training instead of time-consuming self-study and networking. If you want to reduce your budget, you have to be prepared to invest more time and effort in learning, i.e. looking for free webinars, free masterclasses, reading books, volunteer in a community project instead of attending an expensive training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as your personal selection criteria are defined, listed, prioritized and weighted, they are ready to apply to all possible learning alternatives. As an output of this step is to be a short-list of learning and development options to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional development is an exciting and fruitful area, which requires standing focus and attention to stay on track. Because of high resilience to possible process mistakes and imperfections, it is never too late to apply corrective actions and to move forward to inspiring results on the way of climbing to the self-actualization level.&lt;/p&gt;

At the same time, it requires continuous learning and upskilling. If a decade ago an employee with a learning aptitude could fully rely on an employee development strategy of his/her company to keep an appropriate level of competencies and to be fit for a job, in a modern world this strategy is outdated and no longer yields outstanding results. It is time to take a leading role for personal development into your own hands. Sounds great and promising, but the necessity of making choices in a vast variety of learning and development options might hack to death this idea even for a highly motivated person.</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Project management is HR Transformation’s best friend: a true story of one project</title><link href="https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PM-and-HRtransformation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project management is HR Transformation’s best friend: a true story of one project" /><published>2021-06-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-06-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PM-and-HRtransformation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PM-and-HRtransformation/">&lt;p&gt;Digitalization and agility are now ways of life and speed up business transformation, which drastically affects people and their work. HR takes a leading role in workplace transformation and lends a supporting hand to business in the upskilling of companies’ workforce with the primary focus on strategic capabilities and competencies. It also hastens ongoing HR transformation processes and sharps attention on becoming more analytical, more agile, more digital, and more competent in handling challenges. At the same time, these trends nourish another global tendency — the skyrocketing importance of project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from some level of tasks, project management is equally applied to traditional project-oriented fields as well as to various other functional areas. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-02-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
The whole bench of tasks within any functional area can be split into four major categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;administrative,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operational,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tactical,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strategic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, each job consists of a combination of different tasks related to one or several levels. For successful fulfilment of administrative and operational tasks, an incumbent apparently does not need project management lore, while tasks on the remaining two levels call for at least some understanding of the project management principles and their practical usage. I would like to illustrate this statement for one of the non-project-oriented functional areas — human resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often HR is perceived as a process-oriented, conservative, and purely supportive or administrative function within a company, which is far away from agility and project management. It might be true for some small and mid-size businesses, where strategic and partially tactical tasks related to different functional areas are concentrated in the hands of company owners, that the primary focus of their HR function is to be operational and administrative tasks like filing documents, capturing data in HRMS, preparing contracts, benefits administration (administrative); payroll, recruiting, bonus calculation, organization, and delivery of trainings (operational). However, for companies with a standing focus on diverse modern concepts and models aimed to transform the HR function and shift it to an advanced level, a set of tactical and strategic tasks increasingly occupies a significant share of an HR work-routine and project management becomes in demand. Examples of tasks in these categories can be: (re)design and implementation of HR processes, learning curriculum design, target setting (tactical); conceptualize and design of people strategy, talent management strategy, learning strategy, total reward policy (strategic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, HR incorporates plenty of areas where a rational application of project management principles and methods can speedup, systematize, organize, simplify a realization of HR programs and initiatives, reduce the perception-bias of the HR function as an exclusively administrative one, and provide a sustainable ground for a successful HR transformation. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-06-23-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
I would classify typical HR-activities where employment of project management yields tangible benefits as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;responsive projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value-add projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;digitalization;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any combination of these categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive projects&lt;/strong&gt; are reactions of the HR function to a business strategy of a company, aimed to support achievements of concrete business targets. For example, if a company’s strategic business goal is an expansion to new market segments, a reflection of it on the HR side most probably will be programs and projects in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;competency management (assessment of competencies within a company, defining gaps between available and future required knowledge/ skills/ competencies, defining development and recruitment strategies to close these gaps, etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning and development (whom and how to develop and upskill),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recruiting (whom and how to attract, select and integrate),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;audit of internal processes and infrastructure to define and estimate needs to scale/ optimize/ rebuild/ automate existing HR processes and set up new ones, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value-add projects&lt;/strong&gt; are proactive mind-changing initiatives suggested and driven by HR, which are derived from and tightly linked to the vision of a company and aimed to create an internal working environment and a corporate culture in the ‘things to grow’-mode. Often this category of projects lays in the areas of employee experience, agile learning organization, leadership development, employee engagement, change management, and others. These projects require mid- and long-term focus and commitment of a company’s top management, significant investments, and a standing revision of HR processes. Sometimes it is difficult to justify the return-on-investment (ROI) for these projects, and their share in a company project portfolio is always a topic for discussion. Significant internal and/or external changes of business environments regularly make a stress-test for businesses. However, a company, that pays enough attention to value-added HR projects, has higher chances to surmount obstacles and to catch opportunities. The current worldwide stress-test called COVID-19 clearly demonstrates that companies started to pay attention to and invest in value-add HR projects before this pandemic, dispose now of better-prepared HR processes, employees, managers, and corporate culture to face and overcome the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitalization&lt;/strong&gt; is another category mostly dealing with the automation of HR processes. These projects are often derived from responsive and value-add ones. For the technical part of them, the HR function is to act as a project owner to ensure a proper bridge between the HR and IT sides. Digitalization always embodies some changes, and as a consequence, some resistance is likely to pop up. Therefore, the importance of a non-technical side of a project should not be underestimated. HR has a driver’s seat for it and usually extends this role to all digitalization projects in a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the interconnectivity of all people-related topics within an organization, usually it is difficult to separate these categories one from another. In practice, a strategic impetus from the top expands to a variety of sub-projects and mind-changing initiatives covering all types of HR projects. To illustrate this, I would like to share a true story of how one responsive project had opened the doors to multiple value-add and digitalization HR projects and laid the first bricks into a successful HR transformation in a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I joined a country-based HR department of a huge international corporation. From year to year, the business volume of our country had steady minor growth, but it was not enough to overcome the internal label of a “small country” on the global business landscape of the corporation. From a headcount perspective, the situation was similar: our 600 employees were just a drop in the corporate ocean. Our HR department was mainly concentrated on operational and administrative tasks to support immediate business needs. At the same time, we were included in the global HR communication streams, had good connections with colleagues in other countries, and were aware of new trends and methods recommended by HQ HR to be applied in regional companies. Our attempts to discuss and agree upon required changes in working methods with the country management usually faced a polite ignorance and HR business partnering has been standing shelved for better times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation has changed overnight: during regular monitoring of market tendencies and potentials in countries HQ has concluded that our region had a potential for booming growths in different industrial segments. As a result, our business has been challenged to triple its volume in two years, which would allow our regional company to enter a higher corporation-league. One of the required actions to ensure successful achievement of this target was a task to HR: “double a company staff in two years”. This was a typical example of a responsive HR project: time-boxed activities to create a unique result as a response to a business initiative. To meet objectives, it was required to set up a lot of new processes, implement supportive tools, arrange proper in-time communication, and coordinate interconnected activities with other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opening task as a project manager was a thoroughly planned and organized kick-off to agree with stakeholders on the “rules of the game”: goals, scope, deliverables, phases, milestones, quality control measures, resources, budget, communication, and procedures, i.e. escalation, change requests, etc. Starting from the announcement of this project HR was in a “catching up mode” and my project team ran behind the train of business transformation, trying to catch on to the last carriage. At the beginning of the project, time was one of the most critical resources with a zero reserve. Initially, I planned to keep the corporate standards for industrial projects and to follow the waterfall approach. However, the first precise planning session and an attempt to elaborate a workable decomposition of tasks and a project schedule revealed a lot of uncertainty and volatility in some critical project phases. It was dangerous conditions for a project that completely followed the predictive approach and with an ultimate shortage of time. After presenting a risk analysis to the project sponsor and key stakeholders, my change request was approved, and I could change the standard approach to a hybrid one. I’ve reorganized the project into a main operational recruiting stream and sub-projects: for some of them the waterfall approach was reasonably applied, for the rest adaptive approaches were deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-06-23-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most essential sub-projects was an implementation of an E-recruiting system. Its successful in-time completion allowed the project team to catch the train and to start moving between carriages of the business transformation. Five years later, lessons learned from this digitalization helped us tremendously during the launch of SuccessFactors. Another sub-project was tightly linked to the “Attract”-phase of the recruiting process. Employer branding activities, university liaison, and a referral program were parts of this sub-project, and they were pilots for setting up channels for regular HR communication to employees and candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sub-project related to the “Select”-phase of the recruiting process besides some initially planned activities, like to train interview skills of HR and hiring managers, has been extended to different candidates’ assessment tools. This extension later served as a basis for an HR value-add project devoted to the validation of talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning another sub-project: strategic workforce planning. It was not initially included in the project scope, however, in the second year of the project realization, it turned crystal clear, that without accurate strategic workforce planning and its bridge to budget planning on the level of business units, the quality targets of new hires could not be hit. The moment, when a business has followed this HR initiative, was a signal that our HR was not far away from the locomotive and sometimes could proactively influence business. Besides the planning and budgeting processes on the business side, strategic workforce planning has deep connectivity to HR areas: competency management, talent management, and succession planning. Some years later, several value-add projects derived from the competency management area employed these results and brought the personnel planning process in the company to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, was a sub-project related to the “Integrate”-phase of the recruiting process. It was the only one, which initial scope has not been significantly changed during the project realization. Nevertheless, some outcomes of this sub-project served as an impetus for other value-add HR projects like an employee engagement survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to employed from the project management methodology proper monitoring, a consequential realization of phases and sub-projects with a standing focus on a “big picture”, lessons learned, risk analysis and quality control, as well as the immediate implementation of corrective actions, allowed my team to hit in-time operational recruiting targets and to complete the project with well-turned, easily manageable and scalable recruiting processes, an effectively tailored E-recruiting system, and a recognition as a partner from hiring managers. Additionally, the successful project realization had plenty of positive side-effects for our local HR organization. It turned out that involved hiring managers were a critical mass of middle and line managers, who started to spread their partner attitude to other HR areas. Before it was one of the missing elements for the HR function to be recognized as a trusted business partner. This noticeable change of attitude encourages our HR department to foster activities on the internal brand of HR, change of the company’s culture, deeper collaboration with business by offering various value-add HR projects and delivering results, and step by step moving in the directions of the strategic HR business partnering and HR transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back and analyzing factors that supported successful realizations of this and further HR projects in our regional company, the key role should be attributed to project management. Within a well-established corporate project management culture on the business side, its adoption and utilization on the HR side showed up as a “magic pill” or the shortest way to find a common language and speedup the trustful partnership with business at all organizational levels, and to ensure a noticeable move into the desired transformation of the HR function.&lt;/p&gt;

HR projects are diverse by purpose, nature, duration, available resources, and budget, however, some common critical issues and roadblocks can be present in any HR project. Encounter some of them might require significant efforts and additional resources to get a project back on track, while facing a full set the most probably will be killing for project success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-04-26.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholders&quot;&gt;Stakeholders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careless or slipshod stakeholder management can bury any project or significantly multiply its complexity. HR projects are not an exception to this general rule. It is well known that even minor changes related to humans might have huge and unforeseen effects. HR projects are dedicated to and dealing with people. Sometimes it is difficult to predict the entire range of reactions of the affected groups and individuals and to build up a complete overview of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core steps to success in any HR project is proper identification and intentional management of stakeholders, i.e. groups, persons, authorities, or parties which might have a vested interest in any phase of a project, program or initiative. Often, stakeholders have primary drivers in political, economical, social, technical, and legal areas, which determine their levels of interest in a project. Another important characteristic of a stakeholder is the impact or the degree of his influence on project phases and the result. These two characteristics provide the basis for the stakeholder analysis and help to classify stakeholders in distinct groups, for example, actively manage, manage, actively inform and inform. It is worth noting that the interest and the impact of a stakeholder are not once and constantly fixed values; they sway and might refocus over project phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the “iceberg model” the invisible part of human internal drivers is significantly deeper than the visible ones, and comprises multiple layers, which in most cases are not purposively showed, but can be triggered at any moment. This is one reason a stakeholder might suddenly appear, who can negatively impact the timing, scope or resources of a project. Another reason is that this stakeholder most likely had that opinion before, you just did not know or did not pay enough attention to it. Therefore, thorough stakeholder management is one of the key success factors for any HR project. In order to diminish a misunderstanding and resistance, proper communication to different stakeholders through relevant channels should be started as early as possible, be transparent, adaptive, clear, and precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;culture&quot;&gt;Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Culture eats strategy for breakfast”. This idea of Peter F. Drucker can be fully applied to HR projects and initiatives, while they are tightly associated with changes on different organizational levels and related to various groups of employees. Besides a variety of reactions on an individual level, which are expected and usually HR professionals are experienced to deal with them daily, roadblocks and favourable factors of the existing corporate culture have to be taken into account at the initial stage of an HR project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frozen corporate culture is a very rare case. As a rule, it is in a standing changing mode as a reaction to external and internal impacts and influences. However, the speed and degree of organizational changes are not the same for different companies. Planning an HR project, attention should be paid to an existing organizational development level, an average company’s speed of adaptation to changes, a discrepancy between the existing level and a desired or required one to successfully implement changes, which will be engendered by the project. Some of the common reasons for the failure of ambitious and highly strategic HR projects are a lack of attention to a company’s culture and a realistic estimation of a speed of a culture change. For example, in a company with formal roles within a hierarchy and a high focus on processes and procedures, it is hardly workable in one shot to successfully implement an HR project, which as a pre-requisite requires a culture of shared values, goals, and practices that encourages learning through experimentation. If project outcomes are supposed to go beyond colourful dashboards and superficial presentations, ambitions should be aligned to the reality and the project has to be divided into smaller steps, which can be successfully implemented and stream a step-by-step culture change in the desired direction. Corporate culture is the soul of an organization and can engine, accelerate, and favour strategic and development initiatives. At the same time, it could be a sophisticated killer for any HR project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;processes&quot;&gt;Processes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison with culture, processes are more tangible and better-defined stuff. They are a carcass of any complex organization and serve to a chaos reduction and providing of systematic approaches and procedures to deal with both repetitive and unique tasks. Starting from some level of organizational development, processes tend to be integrated, interconnected, and organized into a common system. An effective working system has a good vitality degree to handle manageable interventions, while intentional, but low controlled actions might damage its stability, efficiency, and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR projects touch and in some cases directly concentrate on processes. At the same time, a comprehensive proactive estimation of influence on the complete range of internal HR processes and adjoining processes in other functional areas is not always a strong suit of HR projects. Lack of such proactive estimation might cause a deterioration of a project quality because of a standing focus shift from the efficient way of achieving the required project outcome to a permanent search for workaround solutions and crutches to close unexpectedly emerging gaps. Such activities often stimulate an appearance of an excrescent substance “a process for a process” and hit a system’s integrity and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical issue associated with processes and HR projects is solving the dilemmas: keeping a process simplicity vs. ignorance of a bounded complexity and moving beyond an acceptable level of complexity vs. unreasonable simplification. Adherence to one of the extremes might cause miserable results of an HR project, at the same time a rational navigating between alternatives and their derivatives provides better chances for successful project completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capabilities&quot;&gt;Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last, but not least hindrance for HR projects, is a balanced set of capabilities gained by HR professionals. Hand in hand with strategic HR capabilities, like business acumen, change &amp;amp; transformation, design of HR solutions, etc. has to go a reliable set of functional capabilities and skills aimed to secure top performance of operational tasks and specific project management tasks. For example, the ability of HR professionals to vary communication styles to different target groups to win their propensity can be a crucial factor in the success of an HR project. Communication is one of the powerful capabilities and in a broader sense it is not limited to negotiation and presentation skills, but also has to include the ability to provide business with evidence, facts, results of analyses and fluently discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sets of required competencies, capabilities, and skills are not the same for different HR functional tasks and HR projects. My observations show, that often companies assign as project managers HR professionals from the related functional areas, who in most cases are advanced in leadership and other people-relation aspects of project management, however, dispose of very limited capabilities and knowledge of technical aspects of project management, like planning, estimating, scheduling, quality and risk management, etc. A scarcity of critical technical project management skills and capabilities leads to mistakes from the initial planning, through execution to the closeout of an HR project and might drastically affect the project outcome in terms of time, costs, and quality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To eliminate the roadblock of a shortage of competencies required for successful management and delivery of HR projects and to acquire the desired balanced set of strategic and functional capabilities, HR professionals have to gain and standing master their skills, capabilities, and competencies in the areas of project management, strategic and business management, leadership, and communication. The richer the capability portfolio and better learning skills of an HR professional, the fewer efforts he/she needs to accelerate project management competencies and become a great project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading an HR project is not an easy task, while it is important to keep attention on obstacles and roadblocks simultaneously on strategic, tactical, and operational levels. A biased focus on projecting only high-level topics might cause a loss of connections to reality. In opposite, a primary focus on low-level details and minor specifics might cripple the connection to strategic priorities and the ultimate goals of a project. In both cases, the quality of such project management will be noticeable in delays because of unexpected extra-works, shortage of budget, and poor team engagement. To be successful, an HR project manager has to have a birds-fly view of the project’s phases, its interconnectivity within HR and with other functional areas, its alignment with the business strategy and conformity to the features of corporate culture as well as to be able to go down to operational tasks related to a specific HR area or a process.&lt;/p&gt;

HR projects are diverse by purpose, nature, duration, available resources, and budget, however, some common critical issues and roadblocks can be present in any HR project. Encounter some of them might require significant efforts and additional resources to get a project back on track, while facing a full set the most probably will be killing for project success.</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">PM &amp;amp; HR: Strangers or Buddies</title><link href="https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PM-HR_strangers-or-buddies/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PM &amp;amp; HR: Strangers or Buddies" /><published>2021-03-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-03-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PM-HR_strangers-or-buddies</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PM-HR_strangers-or-buddies/">&lt;p&gt;HR is often perceived by employees as a conservative and purely supportive or administrative function within a company. Even in organizations, where HR has a strong governing role and acts as a business partner on the top level, on the bottom level these HR roles might be invisible. Why it happens despite the standing focus on diverse modern concepts and models, like employee experience, Dave Ulrich’s model of HR roles, Deloitte’s the High-Impact HR Operating Model and many alike, which are aimed to transform HR function and shift it to an advanced strategic level?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of studies and researches related to HR transformation and expected capabilities of HR specialists to support this process. One of the common outcomes of these studies is that HR professionals have to gain new competencies and expand their focus areas for upskilling. From my hands-on experience in different HR-areas, starting from a certain level of tasks, project management skills are becoming very important and required for HR-experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR incorporates a plenty of areas where a rational and thoughtful application of the project management methodology can speedup, systematize, organize and simplify a realization of HR programs and initiatives. 
I would classify typical HR-activities where utilization of project management methodology yields tangible benefits as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;responsive projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value-added projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;digitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-03-17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive projects&lt;/strong&gt; are reactions of the HR function to the business strategy of a company, aimed to support achievements of concrete business targets. For example, if a company’s strategic business target is an expansion to new market-segments, a reflection of this target on the HR side most probably will be programs and projects in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;competency management (assessment of available competencies within a company, defining gaps between available and future required knowledge/ skills/ competencies, defining development and recruitment strategies to close these gaps, etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning and development (whom and how to develop and upskill),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recruiting (whom and how to attract, select and integrate),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;audit of internal processes and available infrastructure to define and estimate needs to scale/ optimize/ rebuild/ automate existing HR processes and setup new ones, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value-added projects&lt;/strong&gt; are proactive mind-changing initiatives suggested and driven by HR, which are derived from and tightly linked to the vision of a company and aimed to create an internal working environment and corporate culture in the ‘things to grow’-mode. Often this category of projects lays in the areas of employee experience, agile learning organization, leadership development, employee engagement, change management, and others. These projects require mid- and long-term focus and commitment of a company’s top management, significant investments, and standing HR-processes revision. Sometimes it is difficult to justify the return-on-investment (ROI) for these projects, and their share in a company project portfolio is always a topic for discussion. Significant internal and/or external changes of business environments regularly make a stress-test for companies. However, a company, which pays enough attention to value-added HR projects, has higher chances to surmount obstacles and to catch opportunities. The current worldwide stress-test called COVID-19 clearly demonstrates that companies that paid attention to and invested in value-added HR projects, dispose of better prepared HR processes, employees, managers, and corporate culture to face and overcome the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitalization&lt;/strong&gt; is another category, where the majority of HR projects are dealing with the automation of HR processes, and often they are derived from responsive and value-added HR projects. For the technical part of these projects, the HR function is to act as a project owner to ensure a proper bridge between HR and IT sides. Digitalization always embodies some changes and as a consequence, some resistance is likely to pop-up. Therefore, the importance of the non-technical side of a project should not be underestimated. For the non-technical aspects of digitalization, HR has a driver’s seat for HR projects and usually applies this role for the rest of digitalization projects in a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An implementation of a self-service portal is an example of this category of HR projects. The technical part of this project belongs to the processes area of HR and IT: revision of the current HR processes, alternatives of workflow’s rebuilding, alternatives of IT-solutions, cost-saving analysis, project plan, etc. The non-technical part spreads to and touches employees’ habits and values levels. This project will be successfully fulfilled, if a working system would be in place and the company staff would accept its necessity, adapt their behavior to use the system. Without paying attention to the non-technical part, the project will fail, even with a properly completed technical part of having a working system in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the interconnectivity of all people-related topics within an organization in most cases, it might be difficult to separate these categories one from another. In practice, a strategic impetus from the top as well as a proactive mind-changing initiative supported by the top expands to a variety of sub-projects and sub-initiatives covering all types of HR projects. Besides that, some common essential elements can be found in all three categories. These are issues linked to organizational culture, challenges of behaviour change, and natural human resistance to change, that have to be taken into account for any HR project. A balanced portfolio of HR projects with the proper monitoring, the consequential realization, ‘lessons learned’ analysis of sub-projects, and HR professionals with the robust project management mindset ensure a successful move into the desired direction of HR transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combinations of words ‘an innovative project’, ‘a strategic project’, ‘a special project’, and countless many “projects” alike, can be met everywhere: on a website of any company, in promotional materials, and nearly in all job ads disregard on a functional area from a boss to an intern. Do we really live in the era of booming project management or it is just a fashionable fad to use the word ‘project’ everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-02-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe that project management is a reach and vitally important area of knowledge and skills. And yes, it can be found in all functional areas starting from some level of tasks. The whole bench of tasks within a functional area can be split into four major categories: administrative - operational - tactical - strategic tasks. Each job consists of a combination of different tasks related to one or several levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my hands-on experience of performing tasks on all four levels in the HR-area, I can give some examples of tasks in this area: filing documents, capturing data in SAP, preparing contracts (administrative), payroll, recruiting, training delivery, organization and facilitation of assessment centers (operational), (re)design and implementation of processes, learning curriculum design, target setting (tactical), definition and design people strategy, talent management strategy, learning strategy (strategic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of different tasks in the traditional project-oriented area - Software Development - can be the following: configure development environment, version control, code and documentation text editing (administrative), coding, testing, debugging, users’ support (operational), decision making on tools, environments and libraries, documentation planning (tactical), requirements definition, definition of system architecture (strategic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be seen from examples, that for the successful fulfilment of administrative and operational tasks an incumbent does not need project management skills, while tasks on the rest two levels call for at least some understanding of the project management principles.
In other words, the bigger share of tactical and strategic tasks in a job requires the wider project management expertise and deeper knowledge on PM-methodology to be successful in the role.&lt;/p&gt;
