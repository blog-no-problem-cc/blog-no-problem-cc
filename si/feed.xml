HR takes a leading role in workplace transformation and lends a supporting hand to business in the upskilling of companies’ workforce with the primary focus on strategic capabilities and competencies. It also hastens ongoing HR transformation processes and sharps attention on becoming more analytical, more agile, more digital, and more competent in handling challenges. At the same time, these trends nourish another global tendency — the skyrocketing importance of project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from some level of tasks, project management is equally applied to traditional project-oriented fields as well as to various other functional areas. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-02-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
The whole bench of tasks within any functional area can be split into four major categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;administrative,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operational,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tactical,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strategic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, each job consists of a combination of different tasks related to one or several levels. For successful fulfilment of administrative and operational tasks, an incumbent apparently does not need project management lore, while tasks on the remaining two levels call for at least some understanding of the project management principles and their practical usage. I would like to illustrate this statement for one of the non-project-oriented functional areas — human resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often HR is perceived as a process-oriented, conservative, and purely supportive or administrative function within a company, which is far away from agility and project management. It might be true for some small and mid-size businesses, where strategic and partially tactical tasks related to different functional areas are concentrated in the hands of company owners, that the primary focus of their HR function is to be operational and administrative tasks like filing documents, capturing data in HRMS, preparing contracts, benefits administration (administrative); payroll, recruiting, bonus calculation, organization, and delivery of trainings (operational). However, for companies with a standing focus on diverse modern concepts and models aimed to transform the HR function and shift it to an advanced level, a set of tactical and strategic tasks increasingly occupies a significant share of an HR work-routine and project management becomes in demand. Examples of tasks in these categories can be: (re)design and implementation of HR processes, learning curriculum design, target setting (tactical); conceptualize and design of people strategy, talent management strategy, learning strategy, total reward policy (strategic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, HR incorporates plenty of areas where a rational application of project management principles and methods can speedup, systematize, organize, simplify a realization of HR programs and initiatives, reduce the perception-bias of the HR function as an exclusively administrative one, and provide a sustainable ground for a successful HR transformation. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-06-23-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;
I would classify typical HR-activities where employment of project management yields tangible benefits as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;responsive projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value-add projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;digitalization;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;any combination of these categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive projects&lt;/strong&gt; are reactions of the HR function to a business strategy of a company, aimed to support achievements of concrete business targets. For example, if a company’s strategic business goal is an expansion to new market segments, a reflection of it on the HR side most probably will be programs and projects in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;competency management (assessment of competencies within a company, defining gaps between available and future required knowledge/ skills/ competencies, defining development and recruitment strategies to close these gaps, etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning and development (whom and how to develop and upskill),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recruiting (whom and how to attract, select and integrate),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;audit of internal processes and infrastructure to define and estimate needs to scale/ optimize/ rebuild/ automate existing HR processes and set up new ones, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value-add projects&lt;/strong&gt; are proactive mind-changing initiatives suggested and driven by HR, which are derived from and tightly linked to the vision of a company and aimed to create an internal working environment and a corporate culture in the ‘things to grow’-mode. Often this category of projects lays in the areas of employee experience, agile learning organization, leadership development, employee engagement, change management, and others. These projects require mid- and long-term focus and commitment of a company’s top management, significant investments, and a standing revision of HR processes. Sometimes it is difficult to justify the return-on-investment (ROI) for these projects, and their share in a company project portfolio is always a topic for discussion. Significant internal and/or external changes of business environments regularly make a stress-test for businesses. However, a company, that pays enough attention to value-added HR projects, has higher chances to surmount obstacles and to catch opportunities. The current worldwide stress-test called COVID-19 clearly demonstrates that companies started to pay attention to and invest in value-add HR projects before this pandemic, dispose now of better-prepared HR processes, employees, managers, and corporate culture to face and overcome the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitalization&lt;/strong&gt; is another category mostly dealing with the automation of HR processes. These projects are often derived from responsive and value-add ones. For the technical part of them, the HR function is to act as a project owner to ensure a proper bridge between the HR and IT sides. Digitalization always embodies some changes, and as a consequence, some resistance is likely to pop up. Therefore, the importance of a non-technical side of a project should not be underestimated. HR has a driver’s seat for it and usually extends this role to all digitalization projects in a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the interconnectivity of all people-related topics within an organization, usually it is difficult to separate these categories one from another. In practice, a strategic impetus from the top expands to a variety of sub-projects and mind-changing initiatives covering all types of HR projects. To illustrate this, I would like to share a true story of how one responsive project had opened the doors to multiple value-add and digitalization HR projects and laid the first bricks into a successful HR transformation in a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I joined a country-based HR department of a huge international corporation. From year to year, the business volume of our country had steady minor growth, but it was not enough to overcome the internal label of a “small country” on the global business landscape of the corporation. From a headcount perspective, the situation was similar: our 600 employees were just a drop in the corporate ocean. Our HR department was mainly concentrated on operational and administrative tasks to support immediate business needs. At the same time, we were included in the global HR communication streams, had good connections with colleagues in other countries, and were aware of new trends and methods recommended by HQ HR to be applied in regional companies. Our attempts to discuss and agree upon required changes in working methods with the country management usually faced a polite ignorance and HR business partnering has been standing shelved for better times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation has changed overnight: during regular monitoring of market tendencies and potentials in countries HQ has concluded that our region had a potential for booming growths in different industrial segments. As a result, our business has been challenged to triple its volume in two years, which would allow our regional company to enter a higher corporation-league. One of the required actions to ensure successful achievement of this target was a task to HR: “double a company staff in two years”. This was a typical example of a responsive HR project: time-boxed activities to create a unique result as a response to a business initiative. To meet objectives, it was required to set up a lot of new processes, implement supportive tools, arrange proper in-time communication, and coordinate interconnected activities with other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opening task as a project manager was a thoroughly planned and organized kick-off to agree with stakeholders on the “rules of the game”: goals, scope, deliverables, phases, milestones, quality control measures, resources, budget, communication, and procedures, i.e. escalation, change requests, etc. Starting from the announcement of this project HR was in a “catching up mode” and my project team ran behind the train of business transformation, trying to catch on to the last carriage. At the beginning of the project, time was one of the most critical resources with a zero reserve. Initially, I planned to keep the corporate standards for industrial projects and to follow the waterfall approach. However, the first precise planning session and an attempt to elaborate a workable decomposition of tasks and a project schedule revealed a lot of uncertainty and volatility in some critical project phases. It was dangerous conditions for a project that completely followed the predictive approach and with an ultimate shortage of time. After presenting a risk analysis to the project sponsor and key stakeholders, my change request was approved, and I could change the standard approach to a hybrid one. I’ve reorganized the project into a main operational recruiting stream and sub-projects: for some of them the waterfall approach was reasonably applied, for the rest adaptive approaches were deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-06-23-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most essential sub-projects was an implementation of an E-recruiting system. Its successful in-time completion allowed the project team to catch the train and to start moving between carriages of the business transformation. Five years later, lessons learned from this digitalization helped us tremendously during the launch of SuccessFactors. Another sub-project was tightly linked to the “Attract”-phase of the recruiting process. Employer branding activities, university liaison, and a referral program were parts of this sub-project, and they were pilots for setting up channels for regular HR communication to employees and candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sub-project related to the “Select”-phase of the recruiting process besides some initially planned activities, like to train interview skills of HR and hiring managers, has been extended to different candidates’ assessment tools. This extension later served as a basis for an HR value-add project devoted to the validation of talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning another sub-project: strategic workforce planning. It was not initially included in the project scope, however, in the second year of the project realization, it turned crystal clear, that without accurate strategic workforce planning and its bridge to budget planning on the level of business units, the quality targets of new hires could not be hit. The moment, when a business has followed this HR initiative, was a signal that our HR was not far away from the locomotive and sometimes could proactively influence business. Besides the planning and budgeting processes on the business side, strategic workforce planning has deep connectivity to HR areas: competency management, talent management, and succession planning. Some years later, several value-add projects derived from the competency management area employed these results and brought the personnel planning process in the company to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, but not least, was a sub-project related to the “Integrate”-phase of the recruiting process. It was the only one, which initial scope has not been significantly changed during the project realization. Nevertheless, some outcomes of this sub-project served as an impetus for other value-add HR projects like an employee engagement survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to employed from the project management methodology proper monitoring, a consequential realization of phases and sub-projects with a standing focus on a “big picture”, lessons learned, risk analysis and quality control, as well as the immediate implementation of corrective actions, allowed my team to hit in-time operational recruiting targets and to complete the project with well-turned, easily manageable and scalable recruiting processes, an effectively tailored E-recruiting system, and a recognition as a partner from hiring managers. Additionally, the successful project realization had plenty of positive side-effects for our local HR organization. It turned out that involved hiring managers were a critical mass of middle and line managers, who started to spread their partner attitude to other HR areas. Before it was one of the missing elements for the HR function to be recognized as a trusted business partner. This noticeable change of attitude encourages our HR department to foster activities on the internal brand of HR, change of the company’s culture, deeper collaboration with business by offering various value-add HR projects and delivering results, and step by step moving in the directions of the strategic HR business partnering and HR transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back and analyzing factors that supported successful realizations of this and further HR projects in our regional company, the key role should be attributed to project management. Within a well-established corporate project management culture on the business side, its adoption and utilization on the HR side showed up as a “magic pill” or the shortest way to find a common language and speedup the trustful partnership with business at all organizational levels, and to ensure a noticeable move into the desired transformation of the HR function.&lt;/p&gt;

HR projects are diverse by purpose, nature, duration, available resources, and budget, however, some common critical issues and roadblocks can be present in any HR project. Encounter some of them might require significant efforts and additional resources to get a project back on track, while facing a full set the most probably will be killing for project success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-04-26.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholders&quot;&gt;Stakeholders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careless or slipshod stakeholder management can bury any project or significantly multiply its complexity. HR projects are not an exception to this general rule. It is well known that even minor changes related to humans might have huge and unforeseen effects. HR projects are dedicated to and dealing with people. Sometimes it is difficult to predict the entire range of reactions of the affected groups and individuals and to build up a complete overview of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core steps to success in any HR project is proper identification and intentional management of stakeholders, i.e. groups, persons, authorities, or parties which might have a vested interest in any phase of a project, program or initiative. Often, stakeholders have primary drivers in political, economical, social, technical, and legal areas, which determine their levels of interest in a project. Another important characteristic of a stakeholder is the impact or the degree of his influence on project phases and the result. These two characteristics provide the basis for the stakeholder analysis and help to classify stakeholders in distinct groups, for example, actively manage, manage, actively inform and inform. It is worth noting that the interest and the impact of a stakeholder are not once and constantly fixed values; they sway and might refocus over project phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the “iceberg model” the invisible part of human internal drivers is significantly deeper than the visible ones, and comprises multiple layers, which in most cases are not purposively showed, but can be triggered at any moment. This is one reason a stakeholder might suddenly appear, who can negatively impact the timing, scope or resources of a project. Another reason is that this stakeholder most likely had that opinion before, you just did not know or did not pay enough attention to it. Therefore, thorough stakeholder management is one of the key success factors for any HR project. In order to diminish a misunderstanding and resistance, proper communication to different stakeholders through relevant channels should be started as early as possible, be transparent, adaptive, clear, and precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;culture&quot;&gt;Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Culture eats strategy for breakfast”. This idea of Peter F. Drucker can be fully applied to HR projects and initiatives, while they are tightly associated with changes on different organizational levels and related to various groups of employees. Besides a variety of reactions on an individual level, which are expected and usually HR professionals are experienced to deal with them daily, roadblocks and favourable factors of the existing corporate culture have to be taken into account at the initial stage of an HR project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frozen corporate culture is a very rare case. As a rule, it is in a standing changing mode as a reaction to external and internal impacts and influences. However, the speed and degree of organizational changes are not the same for different companies. Planning an HR project, attention should be paid to an existing organizational development level, an average company’s speed of adaptation to changes, a discrepancy between the existing level and a desired or required one to successfully implement changes, which will be engendered by the project. Some of the common reasons for the failure of ambitious and highly strategic HR projects are a lack of attention to a company’s culture and a realistic estimation of a speed of a culture change. For example, in a company with formal roles within a hierarchy and a high focus on processes and procedures, it is hardly workable in one shot to successfully implement an HR project, which as a pre-requisite requires a culture of shared values, goals, and practices that encourages learning through experimentation. If project outcomes are supposed to go beyond colourful dashboards and superficial presentations, ambitions should be aligned to the reality and the project has to be divided into smaller steps, which can be successfully implemented and stream a step-by-step culture change in the desired direction. Corporate culture is the soul of an organization and can engine, accelerate, and favour strategic and development initiatives. At the same time, it could be a sophisticated killer for any HR project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;processes&quot;&gt;Processes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison with culture, processes are more tangible and better-defined stuff. They are a carcass of any complex organization and serve to a chaos reduction and providing of systematic approaches and procedures to deal with both repetitive and unique tasks. Starting from some level of organizational development, processes tend to be integrated, interconnected, and organized into a common system. An effective working system has a good vitality degree to handle manageable interventions, while intentional, but low controlled actions might damage its stability, efficiency, and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR projects touch and in some cases directly concentrate on processes. At the same time, a comprehensive proactive estimation of influence on the complete range of internal HR processes and adjoining processes in other functional areas is not always a strong suit of HR projects. Lack of such proactive estimation might cause a deterioration of a project quality because of a standing focus shift from the efficient way of achieving the required project outcome to a permanent search for workaround solutions and crutches to close unexpectedly emerging gaps. Such activities often stimulate an appearance of an excrescent substance “a process for a process” and hit a system’s integrity and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical issue associated with processes and HR projects is solving the dilemmas: keeping a process simplicity vs. ignorance of a bounded complexity and moving beyond an acceptable level of complexity vs. unreasonable simplification. Adherence to one of the extremes might cause miserable results of an HR project, at the same time a rational navigating between alternatives and their derivatives provides better chances for successful project completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capabilities&quot;&gt;Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last, but not least hindrance for HR projects, is a balanced set of capabilities gained by HR professionals. Hand in hand with strategic HR capabilities, like business acumen, change &amp;amp; transformation, design of HR solutions, etc. has to go a reliable set of functional capabilities and skills aimed to secure top performance of operational tasks and specific project management tasks. For example, the ability of HR professionals to vary communication styles to different target groups to win their propensity can be a crucial factor in the success of an HR project. Communication is one of the powerful capabilities and in a broader sense it is not limited to negotiation and presentation skills, but also has to include the ability to provide business with evidence, facts, results of analyses and fluently discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sets of required competencies, capabilities, and skills are not the same for different HR functional tasks and HR projects. My observations show, that often companies assign as project managers HR professionals from the related functional areas, who in most cases are advanced in leadership and other people-relation aspects of project management, however, dispose of very limited capabilities and knowledge of technical aspects of project management, like planning, estimating, scheduling, quality and risk management, etc. A scarcity of critical technical project management skills and capabilities leads to mistakes from the initial planning, through execution to the closeout of an HR project and might drastically affect the project outcome in terms of time, costs, and quality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To eliminate the roadblock of a shortage of competencies required for successful management and delivery of HR projects and to acquire the desired balanced set of strategic and functional capabilities, HR professionals have to gain and standing master their skills, capabilities, and competencies in the areas of project management, strategic and business management, leadership, and communication. The richer the capability portfolio and better learning skills of an HR professional, the fewer efforts he/she needs to accelerate project management competencies and become a great project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading an HR project is not an easy task, while it is important to keep attention on obstacles and roadblocks simultaneously on strategic, tactical, and operational levels. A biased focus on projecting only high-level topics might cause a loss of connections to reality. In opposite, a primary focus on low-level details and minor specifics might cripple the connection to strategic priorities and the ultimate goals of a project. In both cases, the quality of such project management will be noticeable in delays because of unexpected extra-works, shortage of budget, and poor team engagement. To be successful, an HR project manager has to have a birds-fly view of the project’s phases, its interconnectivity within HR and with other functional areas, its alignment with the business strategy and conformity to the features of corporate culture as well as to be able to go down to operational tasks related to a specific HR area or a process.&lt;/p&gt;

Even in organizations, where HR has a strong governing role and acts as a business partner on the top level, on the bottom level these HR roles might be invisible. Why it happens despite the standing focus on diverse modern concepts and models, like employee experience, Dave Ulrich’s model of HR roles, Deloitte’s the High-Impact HR Operating Model and many alike, which are aimed to transform HR function and shift it to an advanced strategic level?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of studies and researches related to HR transformation and expected capabilities of HR specialists to support this process. One of the common outcomes of these studies is that HR professionals have to gain new competencies and expand their focus areas for upskilling. From my hands-on experience in different HR-areas, starting from a certain level of tasks, project management skills are becoming very important and required for HR-experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR incorporates a plenty of areas where a rational and thoughtful application of the project management methodology can speedup, systematize, organize and simplify a realization of HR programs and initiatives. 
I would classify typical HR-activities where utilization of project management methodology yields tangible benefits as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;responsive projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value-added projects;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;digitalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-03-17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive projects&lt;/strong&gt; are reactions of the HR function to the business strategy of a company, aimed to support achievements of concrete business targets. For example, if a company’s strategic business target is an expansion to new market-segments, a reflection of this target on the HR side most probably will be programs and projects in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;competency management (assessment of available competencies within a company, defining gaps between available and future required knowledge/ skills/ competencies, defining development and recruitment strategies to close these gaps, etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning and development (whom and how to develop and upskill),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;recruiting (whom and how to attract, select and integrate),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;audit of internal processes and available infrastructure to define and estimate needs to scale/ optimize/ rebuild/ automate existing HR processes and setup new ones, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value-added projects&lt;/strong&gt; are proactive mind-changing initiatives suggested and driven by HR, which are derived from and tightly linked to the vision of a company and aimed to create an internal working environment and corporate culture in the ‘things to grow’-mode. Often this category of projects lays in the areas of employee experience, agile learning organization, leadership development, employee engagement, change management, and others. These projects require mid- and long-term focus and commitment of a company’s top management, significant investments, and standing HR-processes revision. Sometimes it is difficult to justify the return-on-investment (ROI) for these projects, and their share in a company project portfolio is always a topic for discussion. Significant internal and/or external changes of business environments regularly make a stress-test for companies. However, a company, which pays enough attention to value-added HR projects, has higher chances to surmount obstacles and to catch opportunities. The current worldwide stress-test called COVID-19 clearly demonstrates that companies that paid attention to and invested in value-added HR projects, dispose of better prepared HR processes, employees, managers, and corporate culture to face and overcome the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitalization&lt;/strong&gt; is another category, where the majority of HR projects are dealing with the automation of HR processes, and often they are derived from responsive and value-added HR projects. For the technical part of these projects, the HR function is to act as a project owner to ensure a proper bridge between HR and IT sides. Digitalization always embodies some changes and as a consequence, some resistance is likely to pop-up. Therefore, the importance of the non-technical side of a project should not be underestimated. For the non-technical aspects of digitalization, HR has a driver’s seat for HR projects and usually applies this role for the rest of digitalization projects in a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An implementation of a self-service portal is an example of this category of HR projects. The technical part of this project belongs to the processes area of HR and IT: revision of the current HR processes, alternatives of workflow’s rebuilding, alternatives of IT-solutions, cost-saving analysis, project plan, etc. The non-technical part spreads to and touches employees’ habits and values levels. This project will be successfully fulfilled, if a working system would be in place and the company staff would accept its necessity, adapt their behavior to use the system. Without paying attention to the non-technical part, the project will fail, even with a properly completed technical part of having a working system in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the interconnectivity of all people-related topics within an organization in most cases, it might be difficult to separate these categories one from another. In practice, a strategic impetus from the top as well as a proactive mind-changing initiative supported by the top expands to a variety of sub-projects and sub-initiatives covering all types of HR projects. Besides that, some common essential elements can be found in all three categories. These are issues linked to organizational culture, challenges of behaviour change, and natural human resistance to change, that have to be taken into account for any HR project. A balanced portfolio of HR projects with the proper monitoring, the consequential realization, ‘lessons learned’ analysis of sub-projects, and HR professionals with the robust project management mindset ensure a successful move into the desired direction of HR transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

Even in organizations, where HR has a strong governing role and acts as a business partner on the top level, on the bottom level these HR roles might be invisible. Why it happens despite the standing focus on diverse modern concepts and models, like employee experience, Dave Ulrich’s model of HR roles, Deloitte’s the High-Impact HR Operating Model and many alike, which are aimed to transform HR function and shift it to an advanced strategic level?</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">Project Management: Is it a proliferation of buzz words or a vital necessity?</title><link href="https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PMandTasks/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project Management: Is it a proliferation of buzz words or a vital necessity?" /><published>2021-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PMandTasks</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.no-problem.cc/si/en/PMandTasks/">&lt;p&gt;Within the last decades, the importance of project management has been skyrocketing, or at least such an impression can be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combinations of words ‘an innovative project’, ‘a strategic project’, ‘a special project’, and countless many “projects” alike, can be met everywhere: on a website of any company, in promotional materials, and nearly in all job ads disregard on a functional area from a boss to an intern. Do we really live in the era of booming project management or it is just a fashionable fad to use the word ‘project’ everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/si/assets/images/2021/2021-02-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;float:right; padding:16px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe that project management is a reach and vitally important area of knowledge and skills. And yes, it can be found in all functional areas starting from some level of tasks. The whole bench of tasks within a functional area can be split into four major categories: administrative - operational - tactical - strategic tasks. Each job consists of a combination of different tasks related to one or several levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my hands-on experience of performing tasks on all four levels in the HR-area, I can give some examples of tasks in this area: filing documents, capturing data in SAP, preparing contracts (administrative), payroll, recruiting, training delivery, organization and facilitation of assessment centers (operational), (re)design and implementation of processes, learning curriculum design, target setting (tactical), definition and design people strategy, talent management strategy, learning strategy (strategic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of different tasks in the traditional project-oriented area - Software Development - can be the following: configure development environment, version control, code and documentation text editing (administrative), coding, testing, debugging, users’ support (operational), decision making on tools, environments and libraries, documentation planning (tactical), requirements definition, definition of system architecture (strategic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be seen from examples, that for the successful fulfilment of administrative and operational tasks an incumbent does not need project management skills, while tasks on the rest two levels call for at least some understanding of the project management principles.
In other words, the bigger share of tactical and strategic tasks in a job requires the wider project management expertise and deeper knowledge on PM-methodology to be successful in the role.&lt;/p&gt;
