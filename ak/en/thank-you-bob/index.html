        <p>A meaningful career in engineering disciplines demands an eternal
learning and the most important lessons are taught not by teachers and
professors in classrooms and universities, but by people we meet.  And
rather often, we do not immediately realize what the lesson is or how
important it could be.</p>

<p>A long time ago in a company far, far away (almost 30 years,
Albuquerque, NM, to be precise) I started my career as a hardware
design engineer graduated a mere year or two prior.
Τύχη (Tyche), who has shown me her
kindness many times since then, started early — the company’s senior
hardware design engineer was a legend and an enigmatic figure.
Robert (Bob) R. was a chain-smoker with a heavy southern accent, so I could
barely understand half of his sparse phrases on a good day. He never
rephrased, just waited for his comment or question (was it a question?
gosh… I hadn’t recognized) to be answered. If that had not been
enough to terrify me, company gossip mentioned his contribution to
measurement equipment for nuke tests in the era of real mid-air blasts
and even more exotic designs. I still have no reason to doubt that.</p>

<p>At that time he was hunting for a nasty randomly appearing bug in the
company’s cash-cow product: industrial control system based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rtVAX
300</code>. I was playing in a sandbox with a toy: Digital Alpha
multiprocessor system. It happened that both designs used then new
programmable logic chips. One sunny morning Bob appeared at my office
door and asked me to follow him to the lab. There he showed me a
system with a fair amount of probes attached and some strange-looking
traces on an oscilloscope, and asked for my opinion.</p>

<p><img src="/ak/assets/images/2024/isa300-altera.jpg" alt="Altera CPLD chips" class="align-center" width="300px" /></p>

<p>Hardly surprising, no thoughts of mine seemed intelligent enough to be
said out loud, and I’m still glad I admitted that.  So we just started
to “play around” with the signals, triggers, loads, software,
everything we could touch and twiddle — the usual things engineers do
when they don’t know how to approach a problem. After some time, a
suspicious-looking signal was spotted inside the system. With the
programmable logic, it didn’t take long to change output buffer
configuration and to confirm the guess.  The bug disappeared and hasn’t
been seen again, while I realized Bob had not been familiar with
the new chips and their tools and just learned it that day.</p>

<p>As time passes by, more and more often I talk to engineers much
younger than myself, and only this made me recognize what a wonderful
and valuable lesson I’ve been taught many years ago. Now I can really
comprehend and appreciate the level of professionalism,
self-confidence, and courage the senior colleague exemplified by
merely asking me to come down to the lab. Regardless of knowledge,
experience, status, and ego, there are always times to recognize you
might need help, or just another person around, and ask for it.  While
it is natural to learn from senior colleagues, there is always a chance
to learn something from a rooky too.</p>

<p>Admittedly, too late and it is unlikely you may read it,
but still: <strong>Thank you, Bob.</strong></p>
