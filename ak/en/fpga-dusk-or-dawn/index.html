        <p>In an email conversation earlier this year I’ve been asked for my
opinion whether two major languages for FPGA development (Verilog HDL and
VHDL) were going to die soon and if FPGAs would die along with
them. The first question has been triggered by a provoking statement
that the current leading development language for programmable logic
is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scala</code>. A base for the second question was an approval of a second
major acquisition in the FPGA industry: Xilinx/AMD, which has followed
an Altera acquisition by Intel 7 years earlier (2015).</p>

<p>This post is an edited and translated version of my view of the
current state of the industry and some collateral observations. It has
to be noted that these views have been forming through several years
and do not include into a consideration a current global shortage of
semiconductor products. Despite the fact that this crisis has already
lasted for more than a year, affected all segments of the market, and
is likely to take another two or three years to recover from, in my
eyes it does not represent a consequence of some fundamental
causes. Therefore it will not change long term technological trends,
perhaps only their pace and some local manifestations.</p>

<h2 id="a-dusk-for-verilog-hdl-and-vhdl">A dusk for Verilog HDL and VHDL</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>VHDL/Verilog – that’s yesterday, assembler of hardware development,
today’s governor of the field is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scala</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Traditional hardware description languages: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Verilog HDL</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VHDL</code>
are eerie dinosaurs of languages, but I suspect that unlike their
biological brothers they are not going to die out. At least without
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Verilog</code> no ASIC is possible. For FPGAs everything is more diverse
and amusing, but there are still quite sensible projects on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VHDL</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scala</code>, no doubt, is a cool and fashionable technology, but it is
hardly the only choice available. In recent years <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Python</code> has got a
wide use not only in the development for FPGA but in ASIC simulation
and verification as well. Niche applications are often developed
within a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matlab</code> environment – mostly for digital signal processing
and control loops. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C/C++</code> are used extensively in combination
with a high-level synthesis (HLS) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OpenCL</code>. If one should look
beyond commercial applications and consider research projects, the
diversity is much greater and even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LISP</code> may still be spotted out.</p>

<p>So it looks that traditional HDLs yield their role of prime tools for
FPGA development, however they still exist as an essential part of the
technological chain, similar to the one played by assembler: a liaison
between the high-level language compiler and machine code
generator. And many more languages than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scala</code> alone are coming to
replace them.</p>

<h2 id="are-fpgas-fading-away-soon">Are FPGAs fading away soon?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>FPGAs are falling into decay. Intel has already assassinated Altera,
AMD is about to commit the same to Xilinx. Only China-based
second tier vendors will stay around in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rumors regarding the impending doom of FPGAs are largely
exaggerated. In my opinion the reality is directly the opposite:
demands and technical prerequisites for alteration have been
accumulating through the last fifteen years and we are now witnessing
an avalanche of changes.</p>

<p>Both Intel and AMD are primarily interested in the top segment of the
FPGA market, most complex, high performance and expensive chips. And
they will support an on-going development in this segment. Of course,
Intel may coincidentally slay something along the way just out of
habit, but in any case it will not be the entire FPGA industry.</p>

<p>A significant shortage of offerings may be seen in the middle and
lower segments. Apparently they are not so interesting for
Altera/Intel and Xilinx/AMD, but at the same time offer a notably
easier opportunity for competitors to enter the market and grow.</p>

<p>From the long existing vendors – Lattice is doing pretty good and
acquiring some of former Xilinx customers.  No doubt this process got
a bust from the current problems with availability of components and
right now several products based on Spartan-6 devices are re-designed
with Lattice chips.</p>

<p>Actel/Microsemi/Microchip finally gave up its heavy dedication to
avionics and space-grade devices and released middle-range FPGA and
SoC-FPGA families (PolarFire). These devices are well suited for
industrial applications, retaining traditional Actel/Microsemi
strengths. It is rather surprising that for the SoC family a
new and free Instruction Set Architecture (ISA, RISC-V) has been
chosen. The previous generation devices (SmartFusion2/IGLOO2) are
still in full production and also received a good share of designs
migrating from Altera (Cyclone IV/V) and Xilinx (Spartan-6).</p>

<h2 id="dawn-of-a-new-era">Dawn of a new era</h2>

<p>Two other tendencies have emerged through the last five years, and
both look positive to me: new free and open source software tools for
FPGA development are getting momentum and major companies are starting
to invest into them. At the same time a dozen new companies with FPGA
chips are entering the market – something we have not seen for the
last twenty years. That looked absolutely impossible with
Xilinx/Altera duumvirate dominating the industry. Of course among
these new companies there are several originated from China, but
Taiwan, USA, and Germany are also represented.</p>

<p>For almost forty years of their history FPGAs were fundamentally not
able to grasp a major share of any market segment. The root cause was
that as soon as an application is stable and there is a mass market,
it is automatically economically reasonable to develop an ASIC for
it. So the FPGA dominance in some niche is limited by the time till
ASIC is available to take it over, and the bigger the niche is, the
shorter this time gap.</p>

<p>Today the situation is drastically different: firstly, applications
are very diverse and changing rapidly, so an ASIC development is
largely unjustifiable. Secondly, general purpose CPUs have reached
technological limits of performance increase through twenty plus years
of extensive exponential grow. Thirdly, costs and time to develop an
ASIC for the most advanced technological processes increased dozens of
times. Therefore it is more profitable to design a single FPGA on an
advanced process and use it in ten applications, than to design ten
ASICs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, once again it turned out that the major obstacle is in
the development tools: it is virtually impossible to write modern
software on assembler or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fortran</code>. However <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Verilog</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VHDL</code> have
not seen any progress for decades, so may be considered equivalent to
assembler and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fortran</code>. More precisely (or less exaggerated) progress
has been there and it continues, but it is in no comparison to the
advances in technologies, tools, and methods of software development
achieved in the same time period. To a great extent these advances are
originated from and have been defined by free and open source software
ecosystem expansion. That is the reason I am convinced that a turn
towards free and open source FPGA development tools is exactly the
key, which will trigger an avalanche expansion of FPGA applications
outside the niches established till today.</p>
