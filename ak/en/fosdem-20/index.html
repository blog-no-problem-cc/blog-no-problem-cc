        <p>On the first weekend of February 2020, I visited Brussels to experience
an exciting atmosphere of a global gathering of free software
developers: <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/">FOSDEM 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Besides a unique opportunity to taste local beer and Belgian waffles
FOSDEM provides two days filled in with conversations with interesting
people, a possibility to learn what is going on in free and open
source software development and many areas next to it, and just a good
reason to break a day-to-day routine.</p>

<p>Going there as a mere visitor would not have been for me a
sufficiently potent motivator to bother with all the arrangements and
expenses. To boost self-motivation I had submitted applications for
two talks in a hope one or the other would be accepted. Surprisingly,
both were approved, and that messed up almost all the plans for a
couple months in front of the event.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, those two days in Brussels left behind pleasant
reminiscence, and <a href="https://github.com/ak-fau/fosdem20">presentations</a>
saved on GitHub may be reused or just referenced to. Below are the
annotations of those presentations accompanied by a few comments
looking past.</p>

<h2 id="on-hardware-debugging-of-ip-cores-with-free-tools">On-hardware debugging of IP cores with free tools</h2>

<p>An approach to challenges of an on-FPGA debugging of IP cores based on
free software tools is demonstrated. Various aspects and related
problems of an on-hardware debugging are presented along with the
tools to address them, such as OpenOCD, sigrok/PulseView, GHDL.
Real-life working configuration and missing bits of software are
accompanied by the live debug session demo running on Open-source
Hardware.</p>

<p>Debugging of hardware blocks on an FPGA is always challenging and may
be frustrating, especially with no reliable tools at hands. Way too
often the process turns into developing and debugging of the tools,
instead of a target.</p>

<p>Commercial solutions are available (SignalTap, ChipScope, Synopsys
Identify RTL Debugger, Microsemi Smart Debug), at the same time there
are a lot of well-known problems associated with them: vendor lock,
single target, closed source and not always flexible enough, license
terms and costs.</p>

<p>Owing to free software developers, essential tools for on-hardware
debugging of IP cores are available today. However, there are problems
associated with these tools too. The most notable ones are a weak
integration between separate tools and small bits of code and
configuration files missing here and there. A working combination of
tools among with explanations of how they may be used together to
debug IP cores is provided. A presentation covers such free software
as GHDL, sigrok/PulseView, and OpenOCD. Source code of free IP cores,
all configuration and script files and presentation slides are
available on GitHub.</p>

<p>A live demonstration of the PulseView connected to an in-FPGA logic
analyzer via JTAG interface with an open and low-cost hardware is
presented.</p>

<p>An outline of the open tasks and future development directions
concludes the presentation.</p>

<h2 id="port-luajit-to-risc-vmotivation-first-steps-and-perspectives">Port luajit to RISC-V<br /><em>Motivation, first steps and perspectives</em></h2>

<p>There is a need for a lightweight tools for experiments with RISC-V
custom extensions. Adding support for custom instructions in
binutils/gcc/llvm is out of range for many hardware architects. LuaJIT
includes a small and powerful assembler: dynasm, accessible from
within Lua interpreter. Currently dynasm supports following 32 and
64-bit instruction sets: x86, x64, ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS, and it is
just reasonable to extend this support to RISC-V.</p>

<p>Lua itself is a very compact and simple yet powerful dynamic language,
its JIT compiler (luajit) makes it one of the fastest, if not the
fastest, interpreted language, and it is used in many projects, so
having it running on RISC-V would have use besides the mere internal
need for experimental platform.</p>

<h3 id="looking-back-at-the-predictions-made-18-months-ago">Looking back at the predictions made 18 months ago</h3>

<p>At the beginning of 2020 there were no single language with JIT
support in the RISC-V foundation
<a href="https://riscv.org/exchange/software/">list of Available Software</a>. I
was sufficiently bold in my talk to predict what languages were to be
first to provide it and, consequently, to shape <strong>J</strong> RISC-V ISA
extension, reserved for such languages.</p>

<p>It is entertaining to look at these predictions today. Slide 11
included this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>RISC-V J extension — what language will be the first to shape it?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>what else?…</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s see what is available today in the RISC-V software list (in the
Non-C Compilers/Runtimes section):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java — <strong>5 (!)</strong> Virtual Machines</li>
  <li>JavaScript: V8 and Node.js</li>
  <li>Mono (C#)</li>
  <li>Forth — 3 different systems</li>
  <li>Eclipse OMR</li>
  <li>Ada, Nim, Pascal, Go, Rust…</li>
</ul>

<p>So, was I right or wrong?.. Perhaps, both.</p>

<p>I obviously underestimated interest in porting Java to RISC-V
architecture, but all the languages I expected to be available soon
are in the list now, along with many others I did not expect to see or
even have not heard about before. So, even if I was not exactly
accurate with this prediction, I see it as a very positive sign:
overall momentum behind RISC-V architecture is moving beyond cores and
gaining a traction in all sorts of software ported to the
architecture.</p>

<p>The only pity part for me is that luajit is not in the list, but the J
extension is not in sight either. An opportunity window is still ajar
and a tide of development in both RISC-V architecture and software
ecosystem around it is just at the very beginning with bigger waves to
be expected.</p>
